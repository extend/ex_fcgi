ex_fcgi
=======

NOTE: This repository is no longer being updated. For continued development see [unix1/ex_fcgi](https://github.com/unix1/ex_fcgi).

ex_fcgi is a straightforward [FastCGI](http://www.fastcgi.com/) client written
in Erlang.

Goals
-----

ex_fcgi aims to implement the FastCGI protocol, more specifically the parts of
it actually used in the real world. As with
[cowboy](https://github.com/extend/cowboy), do not expect any evil parameterized
module or process dictionary.

This is a work in progress and suggestions are welcome; feel free to contribute
by reporting problems, sending pull requests or bugging us on IRC on
`#erlounge` at [irc.freenode.net](http://freenode.net).
